## Principles of network applications

### Application architectures

- client-server
- peer-to-peer (P2P)



### Processs Communicating

- *client process:* process that initiates communication
- *server process:* process that waits to be contacted

### Sockets

process sends/receives messages to/from its socket

### Addressing Processes

#### Identifier

- IP Address
- Port Number

### App-layer Protocol Defines

- Message Type
- Message Synax
- Message Semantics
- Message Rules



### Transport Services that the app need

- Data Loss
- Timing
- Throughput
- Security

#### TCP

- Reliable
- Flow conrol
- Congestion control
- Connection-Oriented

#### UDP

- Unrealiable
- No Flow conrol
- No Congestion control
- Connection-less
